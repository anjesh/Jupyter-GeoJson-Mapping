## Jupyter Notebook showing geojson mapping using bokeh

This notebook shows how to generate the geojson map using Bokeh in Jupyter notebook. It uses the zones and districts geojson data of Nepal from https://github.com/anjesh/NepalMaps. The geojson is loaded and transformed as per structure defined in the [chloropleth example in Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/texas.html). 

See the demo in as [nbviewer notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anjesh/Jupyter-GeoJson-Mapping/blob/master/mapping.ipynb) or as [html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/anjesh/Jupyter-GeoJson-Mapping/master/mapping.html) generated using nbconvert.
